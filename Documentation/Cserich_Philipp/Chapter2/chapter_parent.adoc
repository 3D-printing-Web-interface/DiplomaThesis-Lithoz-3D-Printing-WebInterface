== Visual Design

- More technical Approach (Dos and dont's for visual design)
What code is considered clear for specific topics

An applications visual appeal can be split up into several parts. The most important ones are:
- Typography
> Using different Fonts and sizes to emphasize different parts of the text 
- Colors
> Highlighting Elements & reflect the applications purpose
- Layout
> Object arrangement
- Motion
> Action - Reaction

=== Typography
Psychological definition of colours and how to emphasize that in your code

There are several ways to implement typography in projects. 
With the most common being:

- local definition 

1. defining the font type directly in elements with the "font-family" property.
2. defining it in a local css space.

These implementations are not recommended as they are not scalable and can lead to a lot of code duplication.
It is recommended to use these techniques only when using a font that sticks to **one** component.
As this is a very specific edge case, it only applies to a few cases where it is more important to keep the font semantically seperate from the rest of the application.


- global definition

*Defining the font in a global css file, provides a more scalable solution. It reduces code duplication and makes it easier to change the font in the future. Making it the best solution for projects with one or two universally used fonts.*

=== Colors equal decisions
Psychological definition of colours and how to emphasize that in your code - Psychological aspect + Code recommendation

CIE S 017/E:2020 -  *International Lighting Vocabulary* (2011 | 2013 | 2022)

> Color: characteristic of a visual perception that can be described by attributes of hue, brightness (or lightness), and colorfulness (or saturation or chroma).

This definition is a good starting point for understanding the different aspects of color and how they can be used to emphasize on different application elements. The definition claims, that color is a visual perception. This means that color is not a physical property of an object, but rather a subjective experience. This is important to keep in mind when designing an application, as it means that a colors perception can change depending on the observer.
But there is not only a subjective aspect to color, but also a physical one. 
Therefore the distinction between **related** and **unrelated** colors is the first step in understanding color. Related colors are colors that are physically close to each other on the color wheel. These colors are perceived as similar and can be used to create a harmonious color scheme. Unrelated colors are colors that are physically far away from each other on the color wheel. These colors are perceived as different and can be used to create a contrasting color scheme.

==== **Apply**

With this knowledge, you can now start to apply this to your applications elements. Outstanding elements such as cancel buttons or alert messages can be shown by using unrelated or contrasting colors, which will make them stand out from the rest of the Webpage.

The image shows an example of a cancel button that is highlighted by using a contrasting color.

On the other hand, elements that are not as important can be shown by using related or harmonious colors, which will make them blend in with the rest of the Webpage in a natural way.

In the following example, the textboxes are integrated into the scene by using related colors.
