In order to start designing an application, the applications shell must be conceptually built. Placing the logo, navbar and content container is the base of every application. It defines the order and position of the elements for every future page. So leaving too much or little room can negatively impact the users experience. There are several questions that can help to define the page's layout. 

- What is the most important part of the application?
- Is it necessary to access other pages at an instant?

In some cases a navbar is not necessary, since the user can access any page by navigating throw the content. In this case, the content can be placed in the center of the page, and the full window size can be used.

Prioritizing functionality and user expectations over aesthetics is vital when considering the design and development of a website. Start by defining the essential components and features that advance the page's main goal. When these components are ready and simple to use, you may add patterns, shadows, and borders to the design to compliment the functionality.

The page's functionality should always be reinforced and strengthened by design, and software behavior should always correspond to users' expectations. Keep in mind that before beginning the design process, it is imperative to comprehend the objective of each page. In the end, a well-planned website stresses functionality over design to give users a streamlined and effective experience.
