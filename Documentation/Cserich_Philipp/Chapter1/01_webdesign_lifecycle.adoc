- Differences in UI and UX development

As many people are not fully aware of the differences between UI and UX, the seperation of the two is always a good starting point.
While the User Experience (UX) is centered around features and the usability, the User Interface (UI) is about the feel and look of your product. UX has many centered topics included, one of which beeing UI, as the Interface is part of the products experience.

- User Experience includes the feel of the product.

A Products User Experience is its greatest Asset. The general functionality is never enough to create great Web Pages. Without the right feel and an Intuitive Design, it can be really hard to deal with. This will scare new customers as their learning curve is way too steep in the beginning. 

- Different Development Cycles

**Hoffer, George and Valaich SDLC**

1. Identification and selection
A Companies needs and goals are defined too select a project path.
2. Initiation and planning
A detailed plan and a potential project is presented to the company. 
3. Analysis
Analysing the current state as well as proposing different replacements and new solutions.
4. Logical design
Describing the imagined system and its features.
5. Physical design
The description is extended in technological specifications.
6. Implementation
This step includes the development, testing and implementation of the newly created system.
7. Maintenance

The Hoffer, George and Valaich SDLC is very detailed and complex, because it describes the whole process of creating a new system in great detail. On one hand, this is a great way to ensure that the system is well thought out and that no important steps are missed. On the other hand, it is very time consuming and can be very expensive. The clear seperation of steps makes it easier to trace problems and follow all of the progress.


**The Whitten and  Bentley SDLC**

1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Support

The Hoffer, George, and Valaich SDLC has been greatly simplified by Whitten and Bentley. Although much less thorough, it is much simpler to understand and put into practice. This makes it much simpler to put into practice, but it also makes it much simpler to overlook crucial tasks.

The so called *"Frustration cycle"* describes the interchanging process of implementing and designing individual pages. This cycle should be kept as short as possible, because as the development progresses, more and more design problems will be discovered by implementation. If either of the processes takes too long, applying changes will get gradually more time expensive.

This picture should visualize the above mentioned development cycle, which should be maintained as the main development strategy for the implementation process. 



**Software star pattern**

The more user inclusive development "Star Lifecycle", includes its users in all of the developments steps, which is a great way to ensure that the product is actually usable. It's name is derived from the 5 points of the star, which represent.

- Implementation
- Conceptual design
- Task / Function analysis
- Requirements specification
- Prototyping

To make the star principle work, a deep user analysis has to be done. Consisting of Stakeholder analysis, Personas, User stories, User stories and problem statements, which are all used to create a very detailed user-profile. As each and every part of this User analysis is also an essential part in project management, the interconnection between development and project management is getting clearer.
