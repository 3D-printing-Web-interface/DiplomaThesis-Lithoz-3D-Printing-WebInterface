# WebDesign Lifecycle
In this part, the focus lies on UI and UX design. 

- Differentiate in UI and UX design
Whilst User Experience (UX) is centered around the features and the usability, User Interface (UI) is about the feel and look of your product.
[StichwÃ¶rter]
UX includes UI
- User Experience includes the feel of the product.
Must be based on each other. UI is used to highlight and emphasize the UX.
