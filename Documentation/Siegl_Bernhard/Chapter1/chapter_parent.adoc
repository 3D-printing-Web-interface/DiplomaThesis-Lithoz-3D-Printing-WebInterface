= MQTT introduction

== MQTT - Machine to Machine Communication
MQTT also known as "Message Queuing Telemetry Transport", is a lightweight standard OASIS messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). 

The protocol uses publish/subscribe architecture which allows a device to receive and send data. The publisher sends messages to the broker and the broker passes the message on to all of the topics, subscribers.

It is intended to make it as easy as possible with as less as code as possible to use it. It uses a minimal network bandwidth. Today it is used in many industries such as: automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications and so on.

== Advantages of MQTT over other protocols
=== Minimal Client requirements
Clients require minimal recourses so they can be easily installed on small micro-controllers

=== Bi-directional Communication
Allows cloud to device and device to cloud communication. This helps of broadcasting so different groups of devices. 

=== Reliability 
MQTT has three different quality of service levels  

- 0 : at most once

- 1 : at least once

- 2 : exactly one

==== When should we use QoS 0?
You have a mostly stable connection between sender and receiver. 
A classic example for Quality of Service 0 is connecting a front end application to an MQTT broker over a wired connection.
It is okay to loos some messages if the data that is lost is not important.
Messages are only queued for disconnected clients if they have Quality of Service one or two and a persistent session.

==== When should we use QoS 1?
You need to get every message.
QoS 1 is the most commonly used service level because it guarantees that the message arrives at least once or multiple times if necessary.
QoS 1 delivers messages much faster than QoS 2.

==== When should we use QoS 2?
This service level is for critical applications that need every message exactly one time.

=== Security
The traffic is being encrypted by using TSL and for authentication purposes it uses modern protocols, such as OAuth.

==== What is TSL?
TSL means Transport Layer Security and is a cryptographic protocol which provides a communication security over a network.

I will go further into detail in the next topic "http".

== MQTT Broker Architecture (Public/Subscribe)
It basically works with a simple subscribe and public architecture.
You can subscribe to a topic such as “temperature” in this case. Then the publisher “Temperature Sensor” informs any one that subscribed to the topic “temperature”, that the value of this topic changed. The MQTT Client that subscribed to the topic receives the value anytime it changes.

=== Terms
==== Publisher
Publishing messages to a topic is the publisher's responsibility. It does not need to worry about whether the subscribers are online when publishing a message because it can only send data to one topic at a time.

==== Subscriber
The subscriber can subscribe to several topics at once to receive messages. The protocol also supports load-balancing among multiple subscriber trough shared subscriptions.

==== Broker
Receiving messages from publishers and sending them to the relevant subscribers are the broker's responsibilities. The broker also responds to customer requests for connection, disconnections, subscriptions, and unsubscriptions.

==== Topic 
Messages are routed through MQTT based on subjects. Similar to URL routes, a topic is often leveled and split with a slash (/) between the levels. A topic might be sensor/1/temperature, for instance. The broker will forward all messages on a particular topic to any subscribers that have subscribed for it. Moreover, many publishers may send messages to the same topic, and the broker will route these messages to the clients who have subscribed in the order in which they are received.

With topic wildcards, MQTT subscribers can subscribe to many subjects at once. As a result, they can subscribe once to receive communications on many subjects.

== MQTT Use Cases
There are several use-cases for the MQTT protocol. Especially in the sectors of logistics, automotive, manufacturing, oil & gas, transportation. It is also necessary in the smart home sector.

== MQTT code examples

Here is an example of how to subscribe to a specific given topic in type script.

- The "machineStateTopic" variable stores the path for the machine.

[source, typescript]
----
export function startMQTTInformationHandling(){
	mqttClient?.subscribe(machineStateTopic + "/#", (err, granted) => {
		if(err && applicationConfig.modalOptions.showSubscribingError)
			createModal("Connection!", "Subscribing error Information:" + halParentTopic + "#", "#DC3545")
		if(granted && applicationConfig.modalOptions.showSubscribingSuccess)
			createModal("Connection!", "Subscribing successful:" + halParentTopic + "#", "#28A745")
	})
}
----

- Here is the implementation of what happens on a specific event such as "connect", "error", "close", "offline". In this case we call the method "createConnmectionModal()" which creates the modal with the given context.

[source, typescript]
----
mqttClient.on("connect", () => {
		if(applicationConfig.modalOptions.showConnectionSuccess)
			createConnectionModal("Successfully connected!", "success")
		applicationConnected.value = true;
	})
    ----

=== Why did we choose MQTT in our diploma project?
The answer is quite simple, our project partners provided the MQTT connection so this decision was out of our hands.
