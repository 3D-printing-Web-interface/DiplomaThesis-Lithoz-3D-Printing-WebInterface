== 4.6 Conclusion
We know that MQTT has a publish/subscribe architecture and we are familiar with the terms subscriber, publisher, broker and topic. We have a know that alternatives like RabbitMQ, XMPP and Kafka exist and have a general understanding of HTTP. We heard about basic security measurements in MQTT and HTTP, such as TLS and HTTPS, and why it is important to have security measurements at all.

== 4.6.1 Lessons learned
Overall I learned a lot about MQTT and HTTP in general. Especially my understanding of how the MQTT architecture works and how to implement it. Now I am more confident towards MQTT and more open for new technologies.
